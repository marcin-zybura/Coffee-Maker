After loading the page, there are windows that encourage interaction.

The coffee machine allows you to select coffee by pressing a blinking button.

Coffee is selected from the menu.

After selecting coffee from the menu, an animation starts to show what layers the coffee is made of.

The animations consist of: pouring the contents of the cup, animated drops of coffee falling into the cup and a pointer that moves from 0 degrees (0% of the used coffee) to 180 degrees (100% of the coffee).


After finishing pouring coffee it is possible to re-select coffee from the menu after clicking the red button.
